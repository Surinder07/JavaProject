object
	
		instance of the class.

		objects are created using classes.
		
		
		
	class My
	{}
	class Your
	{
		public static void main(String arg[])
		{
			My m = new My();  constructor
		}
	}
		
	My this is a class.
	m object reference  ( object pointer)
	 which is pointing to object.
	 and 
	 object is created in memory.
	 object reference ( hold address of object)
	 	
		
		object reference actual is address of the object.
		
		
		
		My m1 = new My();  1000
		My m2 = new My();  1050
		My m3 = new My();  1100
		
		
		here there are three object references.
		and
		three objects,
		
		any time new operator is used means
		new object is created.
		we have 3 object references and all are poting to different memory.
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		My m4 = new My(); // 1000
		My m5 = m4;  1000
		My m6 = m4;  1000
		My m7 = m5;  1000
		
		
		we have four object references all are poting to same memory. 
		
		
		
	class 
	
	class Student
	{
		private int id;  // properties
		private String name;
		
		// they are acccessed by creating the object.
		// object is an instance of the class.
		public void input() {}   instance methods. 
		public void show() {}
	}
	
	Student student1 = new Student();
	Student student2 = new Student();
	
	
Object characteristics
----------------------

	object state    ( properties ) instance variable
	object behaviour  ( methods)   instance methods
	object identity.  ( how objects are different) wid addresses.


	
		classes  relationns.
		
		has a relation
		is a relation.
